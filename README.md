# OmniAuth Asana

This is a copy of the official OmniAuth strategy for authenticating against [Asana][]. To
use it, you'll need to create an Application and copy the Client ID and Client
Secret. You can create and manage applications from the "Apps" tab of your user
settings in Asana.

> Credit: Much of this gem has been based off the [OmniAuth strategy for
  Github][omniauth-github].

## Basic Usage

    use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :asana, ENV['ASANA_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['ASANA_CLIENT_SECRET']
    end

## Further API usage

For more information about using the Asana API and OAuth, please refer to the
[Asana Developer Documentation][].
